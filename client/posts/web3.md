Lately, I dived head-first into decentralized apps (dapps), smart contracts, and web3 in general.

This site for instance is built in Next.js but is hosted on [**IPFS** (Interplanetary File System)](https://ipfs.io/). Files are hosted on a peer-to-peer network. The data store is [Gun.js](https://gun.eco/) which is a decentralized database.

I also have dipped my toes in to smart contracts. This site has smart contracts for identity, an identity registry, a liquidity pool, and an NFT token minter. More to come on those.
