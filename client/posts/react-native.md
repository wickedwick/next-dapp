Lately my primary focus has been expanding my knowledge into the mobile space. I felt that **React Native** was a perfect framework to get started with.

I started out by creating a simple app that just consumes the [SWAPI (Star Wars API)](https://swapi.dev/). Here is the code if interested: [link](https://github.com/wickedwick/swapi-react-native).

Then I thought I'd go a little deeper and combine what I learned with [Clarifai]() a machine learning API. I used it to identify and classify images. [Code](https://github.com/wickedwick/react-native-material-starter/tree/main/services).

So, then I thought about the fitness app I used and the features I want, but don't want to pay for...
That resulted in Just Lift. A fitness app in which you set up and track your workouts. Check it out [here](https://github.com/wickedwick/just-lift).
